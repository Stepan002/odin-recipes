        <p>This Chicken Shawarma recipe is going to knock your socks off! Just a handful of every day spices makes an incredible Chicken Shawarma marinade
             that infuses the chicken with exotic Middle Eastern flavours. 
            The smell when this is cooking is insane!</p>

        <img src="/shawarma.jpg" style="width: 500px;height: 400px;">
        <p>This is one of my signature recipes that will be very familiar to all my friends because I make this so often. 
            It's off the charts for effort vs output: just a handful of everyday spices, garlic, a splash of lemon 
            and olive oil transforms into the most incredible flavour.</p>
